# slippi-replay-differ

Compares two .slp replay files and checks for differences.

## Usage:

Copy two replays into a folder.
"Node script.js 'fileName1.slp' 'fileName2.slp'"

A 3rd optional field for amount of desyncs to show can be added on the CLI, but the default amount of desyncs shown is the first 15 frames of mismatch.
